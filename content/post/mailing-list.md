From now, sourceforge mailing lists are deprecated. Only one mailing list still
exist for users and developers. See the [discussion](../../discussion/) page
for subscribe/unsubscribe.

This mailing list should be the heart of the VLE community. Feel free to post
both “newbie” and more challenging questions. You can also post very technical,
and oriented toward VLE library developers.
