VLE 2.0 is available. Highlight are:

- All the source code and API move to the C++11/14. Compiler Requirements are
  now gcc 4.9 or clang 3.5 available in Ubuntu LTS 14.04 or Debian GNU/Linux
  Wheezy.
- DSDE/PDEVS kernel can use parallelization.
- Packages can be installed in system (`/usr` or `Program files`) or in your
  home.
- Many dependencies are removed
- Debug mode is simplified
- Observation mechanism is improved: each DSDE/PDEVS function can be obvserved.
- Models (`vle::devs::Dynamics`, `vle::devs::Executive`) can be store in
  executable instead of in shared libraries (`.so` or `.dll`).
- GVLE is completely rewritten in Qt 5.
