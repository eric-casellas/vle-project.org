VLE 2.0.1 is available. Highlight are:

- Windows: updating build and runtime dependencies (ssl, certificates) and bump
  the Qt version to 5.9.6.

- VLE: switches default url from http to https.

- cvle : fix the use of more_output_details option. When using
  more_output_details the comma cannot be used as separator since the comma is
  already used in the format of output variables (Closes #346)

More details on the [VLE 2.0](../../vle-20) page. [Binary and source package](../../download) and [Git](https://github.com/vle-forge/) are up-to-date.
