Two new tutorials are available. In the [first](tutorials/tuto-01) we will
create simulation of two models: an event generator and a event counter from
scratch. The [second tutorial](tutorials/tuto-02) we will create a
*Lotka-Volterra* system solved with Euler. We observe results in output file
and finally we use RVLE to change experimental conditions and perform many
simulations.
