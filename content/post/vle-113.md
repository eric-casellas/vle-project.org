A new stable version of VLE 1.1 is available. This version introduces
CVLE, a HPC simulation tools to build experimental frame and a lot of
bug fixes. More details on the [VLE 1.1](archives/vle-11)
page.

As usual, the source are available in
[Github](https://github.com/vle-forge/) or in tarball on
[this server](http://vle-project.org/pub/vle/1.1/1.1.3/).

### Important features

- Add a new cluster simulations tools that run big experimental frames from
  input files.

### Important bug fixes

- Fix an important bug with definition of `infinity` and `negativeInfinity`
  predicates in the `vle::devs` namespace. These functions are mainly used into
  the Decision extension.
- Fix the simulation kernel scheduler when multiple executives internal events
  are in the same bag but at different hierarchical level. Now, we prioritize
  lower levels.
- Fix source code to C++11.
- Fix some GVLE bugs.
- Fix memory allocation in the `vle::value::Matrix`.
