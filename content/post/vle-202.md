VLE 2.0.2 is available. Highlight are bug fix.

VLE:

- curl: add `-L` option to the curl command line. According to the curl
  documentation, if the server reports that the requested page has moved to a
  different location (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response
  code), this option will make curl redo the request on the new place. (Closes:
  #357).

- vpz: In SAX parser, replace xmlXPath functions dependencies with
  `boost::spirit::qi` function.

RVLE:

- fix compilation toolchain: use the same rtools compiler for both VLE and
  VLE's dependencies.

Appveyor:

- fix compilation scripts to use curl, ssl and certificats.

More details on the [VLE 2.0](../../vle-20) page. [Binary and source package](../../download) and [Git](https://github.com/vle-forge/) are up-to-date.
