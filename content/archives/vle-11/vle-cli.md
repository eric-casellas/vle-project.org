To get access to this application :

* on Linux/Unix, simply type the command `vle --help` in a terminal. The
CLI vle has to be into the `PATH`.
* on Windows, open a command interpreter (application `cmd`) and type the
absolute path to the vle binary location e.g. : `c:\vle-1.1\bin\vle --help`.
By default vle is not set into the path, otherwise the command `vle --help`
should work.

# The _package_ mode

The _package_ mode of vle application `vle -P mypackage` is used to manipulate
packages. A typical use case of these commands is :

First you can generate a template package in the current directory with  `vle -P
mypackage create`. Note that you can use any name for your package, if it is not
already used. To see the package names that are already used,  use the command
`vle --list`. The directory created has the structure detailed in the
[packages](packages) page. Then you could configure and build the package `vle
-P mypackage configure build`.  The configure command actually calls `cmake` in
order to initiate the compilation process. A directory `mypackage/buildvle` is
then created. The build command will call `make all` and `make install`. The
binaries are installed into the [VLE_HOME](vle-home): more precisely into
`VLE_HOME/pkgs-1.1/mypackage`. Note that you can customize how vle calls `cmake`
and `make` via the commands configure and build by editing the [vle.conf
file](configuration-file).

Then you can start modeling (creating/modifying VPZ and cpp files) by using the
[gvle application](gvle). Before simulation, you have to call compilation
processes (commands configure and build).

You can now simulate your models calling `vle -P mypackage mymodel.vpz`. It will
call the simulation of the model  `VLE_HOME/pkgs-1.1/mypackage/exp/mymodel.vpz`.
The output files (if there are some) are produced into the current directory.
If your model contains an experiment plan (many combinations of inputs) and you
want to perform simulation in parallel, you can use the commands `--manager` and
`--processor`. The first one declares that you will simulate all the input
combinations, the second is used to give the number of threads to use for
parallel simulations. Eg.:

```bash
vle -P --manager --processor=5 -P mypackage mymodel.vpz
```

If you want to remove the binaries of your application you can use
`vle -P mypackage clean` or `vle -P mypackage rclean`. The first one will remove
the directory `mypackage/buildvle`. The second one will remove the directory
`VLE_HOME/pkgs-1.1/mypackage`. If you prefer, you can instead use your file
explorer directly  in order to remove those directories.

If you want to produce a compressed archive of your package in order to share
it with others, you can call the command `vle -P mypackage package`.

# The _remote_ mode

The _remote_ mode of vle application `vle --remote` is used to download or
install packages that are available in [distributions](distributions). One can
declare new remote distributions by adding remote URL into the [vle.conf
file](configuration-file). Be very carefull to add only URLs you trust in. By
default, there is the [VLE distribution](vle-packages-distribution). A typical
use case of these commands is :

First you can update the state of your local packages with `vle -R update`. This
command modifies the `pkgs-1.1/local.pkg` and `pkgs-1.1/remote.pkg` located into
the [VLE_HOME](vle-home). The first one lists the packages installed on your
computer, the second lists the packages available for installation. They have
the same format as the `packages.pkg` file of
[distribution](Package-distribution-for-vle-1.1). The update command will also
gives the packages for which there are new updates on the remote distributions.

Then you can search for a particular remote package to install. For example, to
search for the package `vle.output` distributed by the [VLE
distribution](vle-packages-distribution), you can use the command (eg. on
windows):   

```bash
C:\>c:\vle-1.1\bin\vle -R search vle.output
Found remote packages:
vle.output       from http://www.vle-project.org/pub/1.1
```

The command gives the packages that have been found and the URL where they are
stored.

Finally you can install the package with the command `vle -R install vle.output`
this will download into a temporary directory the package source and launch the
compilation processes described into the _package_ mode.

# The _config_ mode

The _configuration_ mode  `vle -C` is a feature that allows you to update values
of the [vle.conf file](configuration-file). It is provided so that users do not
edit the `vle.conf` file directly.
