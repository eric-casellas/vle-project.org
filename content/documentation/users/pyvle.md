PyVLE is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) package for using VLE framework
into Python. It provides features such as loading VPZ files, modifying
conditions values of models, simulating VLE models and recovering simulation
results. It provides other features regarding the experiment such as modifying
duration or seed, obtaining information on models and views.

PyVLE is one component of a generic solution for developing web applications
for VLE framework.

# Installation

You can get source code of PyVLE from the Git repository or using the tar ball
release.

    git clone https://github.com/vle-forge/pyvle.git
    cd pyvle
    git checkout -b master-2.0 origin/master-2.0


Or by wget/curl:

    wget http://vle-project.org/pub/vle/2.0/2.0.0-alpha1/pyvle-2.0.0-alpha1.tar.gz


# Usage

Once VLE and PyVLE are installed, you can launch python and import PyVLE.

```bash
$ python
Python 2.7.2+ (default, Oct  4 2011, 20:06:09)
[GCC 4.6.1] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import pyvle
```

or

```python
>>> from pyvle import Vle
```

The package is mostly based on a Python class `Vle`. In order to know what
functions are available into this package.

```python
>>> dir(pyvle.Vle)
```

In the following example:
* a vpz file is loaded
* initial conditions are modified
* simulation is launched

Outputs are not recovered since the output plug-in of the view is not storage.

```python
>>> from pyvle import Vle
>>> f = Vle("scale1.vpz","glue")
>>> print(f)
<pyvle.Vle instance at 0x7fe231515e60>
>>> f.listConditions()
['condA', 'condB', 'condScale']
>>> f.listConditionPorts('condScale')
['InputTimeStep', 'OutputTimeStep']
>>> f.getConditionPortValues('condScale', 'OutputTimeStep')
1.0
>>> f.clearConditionPort('condScale', 'OutputTimeStep')
>>> f.addRealCondition('condScale', 'OutputTimeStep', 0.5)
>>> f.getConditionPortValues('condScale', 'OutputTimeStep')
0.5
>>> f.run()
```

Notes: The outputs are not recovered since the output plug-in of the view is
not storage.

```python
>>> from pyvle import Vle
>>> f=Vle('/tmp/myModel.vpz', 'glue')
>>> ...
```

It can be useful to recover the results of a simulation. To do this, the output
plug-in of views of the vpz (or at least the view that is expected) should be
set to *storage*. Call to function `run` will return dictionaries (one per
view) of the results.

Here is an example:

```python
>>> from pyvle import Vle
>>> f = Vle("scale1.vpz","glue")
>>> f.setOutputPlugin('view', '', 'local', 'storage')
>>> result = f.run()
>>> result['view']['Top model:B4.b'][5]
20.0
```

To access to the ith value of observables `obs` into the view `view`, the
syntax to use is: result[`view`][`obs`][`i`]:

* `view` the name of the view
* `obs` the path to the model concatenated with the port name. For
  example if the top model, called `C1` is a coupled model containing
  the atomic model `C2` which is observed through the observable port
  `p`, so obs = `C1:C2.p`
* `i` index of the matrix. In a view configured as a timed-view, i
  represents the time step value.

Examples above show how to launch one simulation.  Nevertheless it is possible
to launch a bag of simulations with one call of command

In the case only one simulation is required, method `run()` can be used.  In
the other case, methods `runManager` or `runManagerMatrix` are available to
simulate one bag of simulations.

For one simulation (see above for interpreting results):

```python
>>> import pyvle
>>> v=pyvle.Vle('weed1.vpz','weed')
>>> result=v.run()
# result['view']['path:model.port'][index]
```

For a bag of simulations, results is more complex since they are as many view
dictionaries as couples replica, combination.

```python
>>> import pyvle
>>> v=pyvle.Vle('weed1.vpz','weed')
>>> result=v.runManager()
# result[replicat_index][combinaison_index]['view']['path:model.port'][index]
```

One can find the connection between `combinaison_index` and the
initial conditions values it corresponds to.

```python
>>> import pyvle
>>> v=pyvle.Vle('weed1.vpz','weed')
>>> v.getCombinations()
# n tuples containing the list of initial conditions of the n combinations
>>> v.getCombinations()[0]
#  the list of initial conditions of the first combination
>>> v.listConditions()
#the list of combinations
>>> listConditionPorts('xxx')
# the list of names of conditions port of condition 'xxx' where 'xxx' is the first condition
```
